### UI/UX Improvements 

#### Improve action consistency [#1225](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1225)

This commit improves consistency and fixes a couple minor UI issues:

Moves Image > Push and > Show History to kebab menu, making Image list page actions consistent with other pages.
Adds support for disabled actions in ListItemButtonIcon.
Makes Image > Delete action disabled (vs missing) so that actions line up and don't change position in the list of images.
Makes Container Details > Open Browser action disabled (vs missing) so that actions don't change position when container starts.
Nit: fix imagesUnsubscribe typo in ImagesList

![action-consistency-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19958075/214104678-2d4148d7-484e-41f9-9da9-aecee328ae2b.png)

![action-consistency-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19958075/214104663-64fa0601-bb79-49bf-8226-6a78a88d3622.png)

#### show no logs view when opening logs tab and waiting for logs to being fetched [#1353](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1353)

This shows the no logs view when opening the logs tab and waiting for logs to being fetched.

![placeholder-loading-logs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49404737/216952505-899308ae-183e-487a-b6e5-28832a0b6452.gif)


#### fix: Update Pod status icon [#1326](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1326) and [#1377](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1377)

Currently, the status icons on the Images/Volumes/Pods list (rectangular icons using Font Awesome) don't match the Containers list (square, using a variety of svgs). After reviewing the designs and talking to @mairin we came up with the following guidelines:

All icons should be square, and slightly larger than the existing Containers icons.
All icons should use the associated pod/volume/etc SVGs (which means removing the cool but custom ones in the Container list :( ) to keep the mental association.
Stopped/created/unused icons should be grey outlines; started/used should be filled green and use solid icons.
This PR currently has only the changes to the Pod list - which would introduce a third list style without replacing either of the existing two. I have the rest of the changes ready, but I wanted to get confirmation of both the design and technical direction before committing them. If we agree on the direction, I can either expand this PR or submit a second one immediately.

This change rolls out the consistent status icon change started by PR #1326 to the other places that had status icons: container, image, and volume list, and the container details page.

Minor tweaks to layout to make the status columns identical in all 4 lists.

Old, now unused status icons are removed.

![pods-status-icon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19958075/216671859-bdd8dca4-56b7-40a8-961a-dcb6e01be61e.png)


#### 'empty screen' icons [#1245](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1245)

Fix each of the four empty screens to use the correct SVG icon and reduce code duplication via EmptyScreen.

Switched the order of the if statement in each of the lists because I thought this is more natural, and avoids passing array into each screen to confirm if it is empty.

The volumes empty screen does not appear before or after this change because filtered.length == 1 when there are no visible volumes, will continue investigating via separate PR.

![empty-screen-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19958075/214434367-d50337de-bf53-49be-a1e9-f6c93e6fc870.png

![empty-screen-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/436777/214577726-f4cfde7b-017a-499d-a2a9-e50d455ffaf0.png)



#### ability to manually set color of tray icon for Windows and Linux [#1243](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1243)

Allows the ability to set the default 'theme' of the icon to either
light (black icon) or dark (white icon).

![set-tray-color](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6422176/214415442-ae67011d-e0b9-4214-adbb-c542db85492f.png)

#### better UI feedback when starting pods [#1242](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1242)
add better UI feedback when starting pods (or any action)
Also report error in case of error

#### Fix alignement in badges from the navigation sidebar [#1357](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1357)

This PR aligns badges in the sidebar
![alignement-badges](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49404737/216336502-2a34dea3-fd41-4184-8cfe-9226d70da070.png)


#### enable/disable open browser action based on container state [#1395](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1395)

enable/disable open browser action based on container state

![enable-disable-container-actions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49404737/217284414-1bdc820b-30a8-485e-b0f9-485229026696.gif)


#### hide open browser action in kebab menu for stopped container [#1397](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1397)

it hides the open browser action for stopped container within the kebab menu

![kebab-menu-hidden](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49404737/217487769-e577090e-c75d-4fb6-90fe-59639aa5a3ed.gif)


#### update editor content when pod name changes and disable deploy button when empty [#1403](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1403)

it updates the editor content when the pod name is hangedby the user

![kubify-editor-update](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49404737/217561292-4ad2e355-e356-4890-b596-046afc65b9ed.gif)

#### Make status icon consistent in detail pages [#1459](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1459)

The ContainerDetails page has the container status icon at the top left, this just matches it in the other details pages.

Note that until #1437 or an equivalent fix is merged the image status icon will always be the 'unused' (outline icon) even if the image is used (solid green icon). IMHO we don't need to block this PR as the code is independent and most people won't notice the minor visual inconsistency.
